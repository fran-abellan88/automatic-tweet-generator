        "LLM agents learning to use tools, from scratch, seems less like a training run and more like watching a toddler figure out a remote control.",
        "Current methods for LLM agent tool-learning often demand extensive, curated datasets of task-solution pairs. A significant bottleneck for real-world deployment.",
        "Tool-R0 introduces a self-evolving framework. LLM agents generate their own training data, learn from feedback, and refine tool-use strategies without human-annotated examples.",
        "This iterative self-improvement allows agents to adapt to new tools and environments. Essentially, they teach themselves how to use the hammer, then how to use the wrench.",
        "For practitioners, this means potentially faster LLM agent deployment. Less time on data curation, more on defining the problems for autonomous systems to solve. A quieter revolution. #LLMAgents"
